   ///          meaning the pin is LOW when not pressed. CA buttons are wired to connect the pin 
   ///          to LOW when pressed (onValue = LOW) meaning the pin is HIGH when not pressed.

   ///          pull-down resistor if the board supports it (e.g. pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLDOWN)).  
   /// @note The three buttons, S1, S2, and S3 on the Binary Clock Shield, are wired CC.  
   ///          On the development board, for example, the serial time button is wired CA.
